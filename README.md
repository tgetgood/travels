# What a Simple Travel App Could Be

## Note

This project has officially suffered heat death. Not only has every link rotted
away, but the Google Maps API has changed and the API calls no longer work as
expected.

Now 8 years may seem like a long time on the web, but historically speaking it's
nothing; under one third of a generation. If we actually expect to be able to
look back at the web as an historical resource and try to learn something we're
in deep trouble.

## End note

Quick experiment in new UIs for travel exploration. Often the number of things
one might do in a new location is overwhelming and cross referencing them can
take a lot of time. Personally I'd rather spend my limited time in a place
seeing it, not reading about it.
